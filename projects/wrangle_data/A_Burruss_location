I moved to South Florida several years ago and my first career position involved a commute from my home in the West Palm Beach area to Boca Raton, FL.  I spent most of the journey on the Tri-Rail commuter train line (www.trirail.com).  I had the pleasure of seeing a variety of neighborhoods and communities throughout the county, and I was glad to share some of my travels through this data science project.
